This plugin will apply several dynamic classes to your <body> tag.  Use it like so in your template:

<body{exp:classee_body}>

That's it.  You'll now get a classed-up <body> tag using URI segments, the current member group, and type of archive page (category, paged, or monthly).

For example, if the current URI was:

http://mydomain.com/magazine/articles/c/politics/P20/ 

Your <body> tag would look like this:

<body class="magazine articles politics category paged P20 superadmin">

(In this case, you'd be logged-in as a SuperAdmin, and your category keyword would be "c".)

Member groups 1 through 5 will be classed using their group names (superadmin, banned, guest, pending, member), whereas custom member groups will be classed "groupidN" (N being the member group ID).

Numeric URI segments (for example, when calling an entry via its entry_id) will be prepended with the letter "n", i.e.

http://mydomain.com/magazine/articles/246

Would yield:

<body class="magazine articles n246 groupid7">

Lastly, if there are no URI segments to be found, your <body> will get the class of "home".
